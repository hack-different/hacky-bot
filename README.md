# hacky-bot

This is our helpful if snarky bot

## Features (Planned)

### Embargo Dubious Sources of Information 

To generalize rules we have regarding bad info sources, a bit should be able to scan messages/URLs for "embargoed" sources.  It can handle this in two levels.  We can "tag" bad sources in a similar fashion to how Twitter handles misinformation.  A stronger approach is to remove the affected message and provide data that a message was removed.

### Rule Violations

This same model can handle tons of common cases like "eta wen", "iCloud bypass" etc to reduce mod workload

### Legitimize

Auto handling "#Legit" by ensuring a verified GitHub / Twitter, and allowing a user to ask for legit by providing work samples that go into a work queue.

This would also keep discord roles in sync with GitHub team memberships 

### Report

This is a command to allow a user to ping for mod attention

### 'wtfis' / 'whois'

Looks up users, tools, repos and terms

### Releases

Could auto message an announcement channel on relevant new versions.  Ideally this is a list of things users can opt into

### Moderation Tools

Keeping context on mod actions over time, public mod logs etc

### Collection of Code / GitHub Repos

Let's not loose knowledge, code and GitHub links can be synced to the repo
