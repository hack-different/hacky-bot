# hacky-bot

This is our helpful if snarky bot...

This will help you get started:
https://github.com/oceanroleplay/discord.ts

## Features (Planned)

### Embargo Dubious Sources of Information

To generalize rules we have regarding bad info sources, a bit should be able to scan messages/URLs for "embargoed"
sources. It can handle this in two levels. We can "tag" bad sources in a similar fashion to how Twitter handles
misinformation. A stronger approach is to remove the affected message and provide data that a message was removed.

### Rule Violations

This same model can handle tons of common cases like "eta wen", "iCloud bypass" etc to reduce mod workload

### Legitimize

Auto handling "#Legit" by ensuring a verified GitHub / Twitter, and allowing a user to ask for legit by providing work
samples that go into a work queue.

This would also keep discord roles in sync with GitHub team memberships

### Report (Partially Implemented)

This is a command to allow a user to ping for mod attention

### 'wtfis' / 'whois'

Looks up users, tools, repos and terms

### Releases

Could auto message an announcement channel on relevant new versions. Ideally this is a list of things users can opt into

### Moderation Tools

Keeping context on mod actions over time, public mod logs etc

### Collection of Code / GitHub Repos

Let's not loose knowledge, code and GitHub links can be synced to the repo
